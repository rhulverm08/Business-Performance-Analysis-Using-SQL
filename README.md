Objectives

Analyze structured business data using SQL

Answer business-driven analytical questions

Apply advanced SQL concepts to extract insights

Improve data-driven decision-making

Demonstrate SQL proficiency for analytical use cases

Dataset Description

The dataset represents a realistic business scenario and includes structured tables such as:

Customer information

Transaction and sales records

Date and category attributes

Numerical performance metrics

The dataset is designed to support analytical queries commonly used in business intelligence and reporting.

Tools and Technologies

SQL (MySQL)

SQL Client / IDE (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or DB Browser)

Microsoft Excel (for data validation and exploration)

Analysis Workflow
1. Database Setup

Created database schema

Imported tables into the database

2. Data Exploration

Used SELECT queries to understand table structures

Checked record counts and data quality

3. Core SQL Analysis

Filtering and sorting using WHERE and ORDER BY

Aggregations using COUNT, SUM, AVG

Grouping using GROUP BY and HAVING

4. Advanced SQL Concepts

INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN

Subqueries

CASE WHEN logic

Date-based analysis

5. Business Insights Extraction

Identified top-performing segments

Analyzed trends and patterns over time

Highlighted inefficiencies and improvement opportunities

Key Business Questions Answered

Which categories or segments perform the best?

Which customers or segments contribute the most to revenue?

How does business performance change over time?

Which areas require improvement based on data trends?

SQL Concepts Used

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY

GROUP BY, HAVING

JOINs (INNER, LEFT)

Subqueries

CASE statements

Aggregate functions

Date functions

Key Insights

A small number of segments contribute significantly to overall performance

Trend analysis helps identify growth and decline periods

Structured SQL queries simplify complex business questions

Aggregations and joins provide clarity on performance drivers

Limitations

Dataset size is limited to available records

External business factors are not included

Analysis is based on historical data only

Future Enhancements

Implement window functions for advanced analytics

Create SQL views for reusable reporting

Integrate SQL outputs with Power BI dashboards

Automate recurring analytical queries

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used as a powerful analytical tool to transform raw data into actionable business insights. It reflects readiness for entry-level to junior data analyst roles by combining technical SQL skills with analytical thinking.
